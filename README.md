# üìñTutorialsüìñ

A place to store and share any useful slides from tutorials and workshops attended at training events/conference workshops etc. Click [here](https://github.com/BioDivHealth/Common_Scripts/tree/main/Tutorials) for a veritable treasure chest of coding tutorials. Slides beginning "CC" are Elise's old slides for Coding Club tutorials. Perhaps a bit basic for your needs but feel free to re-use them for teaching purposes. They're designed for R beginners and undergrads.
